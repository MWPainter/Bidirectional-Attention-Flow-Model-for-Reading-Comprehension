# CS224n - Bidirectional Attention Flow Model for Reading Comprehension 
CS224N Project Assignment 4 - Reading Comprehension Project.
The project has several dependencies that have to be satisfied before running the code.

# Requirements

This project assumes installation of Python 2.7, as well as a TensorFlow 0.12.1.

It should also install all needed dependnecies through
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Running the project

You can get started by downloading the datasets and doing dome basic preprocessing:

$ code/get_started.sh

Note that you will always want to run your code from this assignment directory, not the code directory, like so:

$ python code/train.py

This ensures that any files created in the process don't pollute the code directoy.


# Final Results:
**N.B. These results were obtained just after the report deadline :( therefore are inconsistent with the report**
F1 score: 61%
EM score: 42%
